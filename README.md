# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted. 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest is over and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Contest prep

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Contest prep
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/README.md))
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 8 hours prior to contest start time.**
- [ ] Ensure that you have access to the _findings_ repo where issues will be submitted.
- [ ] Promote the contest on Twitter (optional: tag in relevant protocols, etc.)
- [ ] Share it with your own communities (blog, Discord, Telegram, email newsletters, etc.)
- [ ] Optional: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

## How it works

### Summary

Backed protocol enables peer-to-peer loans with NFT collateral. Its main unique features are
1. No back and forth negotations: Borrowers propose minimum viable terms (loan asset, minimum loan amount, minimum duration, max interest rate) and the loan starts immediately once a lender meets or beats the minimum terms. 
2. No oracles: borrowers and lenders agree to loan terms and that's all that matters. The only "liquidation" type event is that lenders can seize the NFT collateral if the loan is past due.
3. Composability: borrowers get Borrow Tickets and lenders get Lend Tickets. Control flows query for the current owner of these ticket, rather than a static borrower/lender address. For example, when a loan is repaid, the funds go to the Lend Ticket holder, whoever that happens to be at the moment of that transaction. 
4. Perpetual lender buyout: a lender can be boughtout at any time by a new lender who meets the existing terms and beats at least one term by at least 10%, e.g. 10% longer duration, 10% higher loan amount, 10% lower interest. The new lender pays the previous lender their principal + any interest owed. The loan duration restarts on buyout.

**Note** this audit is focused on just a portion of the code, excluding contracts used for generating on-chain art for the lend and borrow tickets. Only the contracts listed in the table above are in scope. 

### Detail
#### Walkthrough
##### Step 1: Create Loan
The first step in the loan process is for a potential borrower to create a loan. In this transaction, (1) the NFT collateral is transferred to the NFT loan facilitator contract (2) the loan terms are set based on values passed by the caller (loan asset, minimum loan amount, maximum interest rate, minimum duration), and (3) a Borrow Ticket NFT is transferred to an address of the callers choosing. The Borrow Ticket is significant in that (1) the holder can close the loan before it is underwritten and get the NFT collateral back, (2) when the loan is underwritten, the loan amount is transferred the Borrow Ticket holder and (3) on repayment, the NFT collateral is sent to the Borrow Ticket holder.

##### Step 2: Lend
Anyone can lend to a loan by submitting terms that meet or beat the loan terms (beating meaning higher amount, lower interest, or longer duration). On lend, the loan amount of the loan asset is transferred from the caller to the NFT loan facilitator contract. The facilitator contract then immediately passes on the loan amount, minus an origination fee, to the address holding the Borrow Ticket corresponding to this loan (Borrow Ticket token id == loan id). The facilitator contract mints and a Lend Ticket NFT to the lender. The Lend Ticket is significant in that (1) On loan repayment, funds are sent to the holder of the Lend Ticket and (2) the holder of the Lend Ticket NFT can seize the NFT collateral if the loan is past due. 

Throughout the loan duration, anyone can buyout the existing underwriter by meeting the existing terms and beating at least one of them by at least `requiredImprovementRate`, which is initialized at 10%, e.g. 10% longer duration, 10% higher amount, 10% lower interest rate. A buyout requires paying the existing underwriter their principal plus the interest accrued on the loan so far. A buyout transfers the Lend Ticket to the new underwriter.

##### Step 3: Repay
Anyone can repay the loan, transferring principal plus interest accrued interest amount of the loan asset to the Lend Ticket holder and transferring the collateral NFT to the Borrow Ticket holder. The loan is then closed.

##### Step 3: Seize Collateral
If the loan repayment is past due, the Lend Ticket holder can seize the collateral. The collateral NFT will be transferred to an address passed in by the Lend Ticket holder.
